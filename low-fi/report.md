# Studygram DPM 3 Report

## Problem Statement
University students miss out on collaborative study opportunities in classes due to feeling uncomfortable approaching classmates and continuing to engage with them throughout the semester, leading to isolated learning and lower academic performance.

## Tasks
1. Take a quiz when entering the app for the first time, find out your learning type and get matched with other students based on it
1. Create a flashcard set or add cards to already existing sets created by your group; receive a publically visible reward and possibly an accessory for your avatar
1. Test yourself with a set of cards and upvote or downvote cards along the way
1. See the log of your group's joint study sessions and create a new one in ~one click; the rest of the group can hop on

## Prototype
#### Link
Our prototype is available here: [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/umK9e0xpKP2qjlNV1JeIfc/Studygram?node-id=0-1&m=dev). It is a dev link, please enter the presentation mode for Start flowx to view it.
#### Summary
This tool is designed to help students find social 
#### Design Choices
- Gamified elements such as walking around and approaching others with your avatar pet due to Figma's limitations of prototyping continuous movement
- Typing is not implemented and instead hard-coded into the prototype
- Only the quiz is implemented among all Sign Up steps since the rest is irrelevant to our chosen problem's solution
- Consequences of others down- or upvoting one's cards are not displayed, though it will be reflected in coin count or similar stats
- Return button is not working on each Figma frame since the purpose is to create a convenient flow of exploring our tool's features, not show all the transitions possible
- We did not add the learnine streak and other accomplishments' reflection in the pet/avatar's appearance that is supposed to contribute to the user's experience as a social recognition opportunity. This is due to other tasks implemented having more direct social interactions and limitations of Figma simulation for progression of a pet's lifetime
- Coin count is not reflected correctly in all the transitions to enable loops in the prototype
- Low-fi prototype of group study session reflects the general flow of the process and does not address edge cases such as users attempting to game the system
