# Studygram DPM 3 Report
Gamify Labs: Alua Kaliazhdarova, Olesia Bilyk, Johan Ronnquist, Sche In Baek
## Problem Statement
University students miss out on collaborative study opportunities in classes because they feel uncomfortable approaching classmates they do not know well, leading to isolated learning and lower academic performance.

## Tasks
1. Take a quiz when entering the app for the first time, find out your learning type and get matched with other students based on it
1. Create a flashcard set or add cards to already existing sets created by your group; receive a publically visible reward and possibly an accessory for your avatar
1. Test yourself with a set of cards and upvote or downvote cards along the way
1. See the log of your group's joint study sessions and create a new one in ~one click; the rest of the group can hop on

## Prototype
#### Link
Our prototype is available here: [Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/umK9e0xpKP2qjlNV1JeIfc/Studygram?node-id=0-1&m=dev). It is a dev link, please enter the presentation mode for Flow 1 to view it.
#### Summary
It's the best
#### Design Choices
- Gamified elements such as walking around and approaching others with your avatar pet due to Figma's limitations of prototyping continuous movement
- Typing is not implemented and instead hard-coded into the prototype
- Only the quiz is implemented among all Sign Up steps since the rest is irrelevant to our chosen problem's solution
- Consequences of othersdown- or upvoting one's cards are not displayed, though it will be reflected in coin count or similar stats
