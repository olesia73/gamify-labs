## Problem Statement
University students struggle to connect with their peers in class due to shyness and other reasons for communication barriers, missing opportunities in social communication and efficient learning.

## Problem Background
In an article by Okoli et al., it has been shown that students who engage very often in social activities show relatively higher educational attainment. In the case of international students, language proficiency is a key factor in social integration, as individuals who lack proficiency often face isolation. With online communication known to lower the entry barrier for social interaction, these findings combined provided a basis for seeking a solution in social computing. After our observations and experiences, we noticed that international students at KAIST struggle to find classmates to study with, as Korean students mostly prefer working only with other Koreans to minimise communication in English. Some professors verbally encourage collaboration with international students, but this has proven insufficient in the majority of cases.
## Motivation
A study by Brundage et al. has shown that unguided group work can positively affect the performance of individual students and solve problems that they have failed to approach on their own, without any need for instructor feedback. This highlights how important communication between classmates is for efficient learning. Unfortunately, some university students might hesitate to approach their classmates due to shyness or other circumstances. To tackle this issue, Steinfield et al. proved that the use of online social network sites can positively affect the communication for low self-esteem individuals by lifting the awkwardness of real-life interactions, making social computing an ideal way to approach this problem. However, big social media like Instagram might not be a suitable medium for academic collaboration, as they focus more on entertainment and general socialization. Thus, there is a need for a dedicated academic-social platform that is structured to facilitate accessible collaborative learning.

## HMW Questions
- HMW make **collaborative studying** feel as engaging and rewarding as a **multiplayer game**?
- HMW visualize and **celebrate class-wide progress** in ways that build community without toxic competition?
- HMW help classmates quickly find and join **the right study partners** or groups (shared goals, schedule, pace) without awkwardness?
- HMW leverage **friendly competition** to transform individual study tasks into **shared social experiences**? 
- HMW make **communication** between students **easier** across the **language barrier** and design activities that bring international and local students together?
- HMW encourage students to teach/**help each other** naturally and without cheating?
- HMW **convert** people who work **alone to** working in a learning **group**?
- HMW encourage people to continue **learning together regularly**? 
- HMW create **new ways of learning digitally** and thus developing new study habits?
- HMW **prepare** students for peer review in research and other crucial **work-related social interactions**?

To select the top three questions, we first held a vote and then discussed the ties. Since we were especially eager to tackle the lack of socialization, the first two questions were chosen as different approaches addressing it—one focusing on collaboration and the other on friendly competition. The last question was among our favourites because regular learning would enhance group experience by not leaving anyone out of team projects for long.
### Selected HMW Questions
1. HMW help classmates quickly find and join the right study partners or groups (shared goals, schedule, pace) without awkwardness?
2. HMW leverage friendly competition to transform individual study tasks into shared social experiences? 
3. HMW encourage people to continue learning together regularly?

## Solution Ideas
1. *HMW help classmates quickly find and join the right study partners or groups (shared goals, schedule, pace) without awkwardness?*
    - Create a short, fun quiz for students to identify their "study style" (e.g., "Visual Learner," "Practice-Problem Grinder," "Conceptual Debater"). The platform can then recommend compatible partners, turning an awkward search into a fun, data-driven match.
    - Co-Study Feed: Students can make their timed study sessions public, creating a live feed of activities that classmates can join with a single click, turning a high-pressure task into a low-stakes, joinable event.
    - Create study groups with an explanation of the goal and the way of studying inside a group so users can choose in which group they would like to study.
    - Targeting online study groups: Make all users use nicknames rather than their real names so nationality and gender can’t be seen.
    - Create anonymous boards, so students can post questions or form study groups based on their needs.
    - Reconfigure study groups for each next time period based on goals set by students and current progress, not friend preferences (for instance, could be based on papers picked for reading for this class).
    - Peer review for periodic HW (1. student gets matched with a grader for a problem; they tell their solution; if the agreement regarding the grade is not reached, TA resolves 2. afterwards, if student didn’t solve the problem, they get matched with a student who did and should explain the solution to them) - not study sessions per se but more feedback received.
2. *HMW leverage friendly competition to transform individual study tasks into shared social experiences?*
    - Community Challenges, where any student can set a public goal for the class, like "collectively study 100 hours." The platform automatically tracks everyone's contributions, and all participants earn a badge when the goal is met. This feature turns studying into a student-led, collaborative game without needing professor setup.
    - Students can join virtual study rooms to work in focused 25-minute sprints. The competitive part is seeing who can stay focused the longest, but the 5-minute breaks are for shared chat, making it a social experience that boosts individual productivity.
    - A shared document where the whole class can share class notes.
    - Provide points depending on how much contribution had been made by a user and use the points as rewards or other benefits, for which students might set their shyness aside (for instance, 1-day deadline extensions, picking the presentation day first, etc.), based on the ranking of whoever first met the point total goal, which adds an extra layer of competitiveness on top of regular individual course assignments.
    - Let users rate the contribution from others and depending on the rate, provide points or make a ranking system.
    - Timed contests or quizzes related to the class material, for example, based on weekly flashcards with MCQs. Ranks will be shown after the timer ends. 
3. *HMW encourage people to continue learning together regularly?*
    - Daily Focus Streak to build consistent study habits. The primary way to extend the streak is universal: complete one focused group study session, like a 25-minute Pomodoro, each day. For more direct engagement, users could alternatively complete a short, AI-generated quiz on recent topics.
    - Data-Driven Study Insights to show users what successful students did in the past. It provides anonymous, aggregated stats like, "Top performers last semester studied an average of 45 hours." This gives users a clear, data-backed goal to aim for, powerfully linking their effort to proven success. Add a progress bar to make students feel more motivated. 
    - Save data over multiple learning sessions. For example, don’t stop after one exam. Users can use the data of one learning period for the next learning period, so people can get a history and see the results of past exams to improve or adjust their learning habits.
    - Make study journal a part of the online system, add extra points to students’ rankings if they logged working on a class on several different days throughout the week (with a pass/fail goal to avoid gaming the system), send reminders to others.
    - Have a visible to everyone Tamagotchi-ish creature that thrives from the student's social activity on the system (starting from small things such as others liking the student's board responses). A student's Tamagotchi can be positively affected only by others for its owner contributions (one can pet somebody else's Tamagotchi after finishing a study session with their owner, by liking their board answer, etc.) Having a well-nurtured Tamagotchi would 1. generate encouragement messages from the pet to its owner (social presence effect) 2. serve as an incentive for others to see the student as a promising study buddy and thus help them minimize the need to look for partners on their own.
### Best Solutions
**Solution to HMW 1:** Create a short, fun quiz for students to identify their "study style" (e.g., "Visual Learner," "Practice-Problem Grinder," "Conceptual Debater"). The platform can then recommend compatible partners, turning an awkward search into a fun, data-driven match. The platform suggests a match for each student, lifting them of the duty to approach others and thus removing the fear of rejections some people might face.\
**Solution to HMW 2:** Provide points depending on how much contribution had been made by a user and use the points as rewards or other benefits, for which students might set their shyness aside (for instance, 1-day deadline extensions, picking the presentation day first, etc.), based on the ranking of whoever first met the point total goal, which adds an extra layer of competitiveness on top of regular individual course assignments. \
**Solution to HMW 3:** Have a visible to everyone Tamagotchi-ish creature that thrives from the student's social activity on the system (starting from small things such as others liking the student's board responses). A student's Tamagotchi can be positively affected only by others for its owner contributions (one can pet somebody else's Tamagotchi after finishing a study session with their owner, by liking their board answer, etc.) Having a well-nurtured Tamagotchi would 1. generate encouragement messages from the pet to its owner (social presence effect) 2. serve as an incentive for others to see the student as a promising study buddy and thus help them minimize the need to look for partners on their own.
